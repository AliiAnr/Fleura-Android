<!-- Test -->
- Minimum SDK level 24
- Architecture
MVVM Architecture (View - ViewModel - Model) Repository Pattern
- [Retrofit2 & OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/retrofit): Construct the REST APIs and paging network data.
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide): Loading images from network.
- [Jetpact Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose?gclid=CjwKCAjwkLCkBhA9EiwAka9QRoDjsHwvjkPI1IqNOZk6H4kdF3VYhhhCG0pKZXUIxHW3jD3W2eDuHBoClgIQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) : Jetpack Compose is a modern UI toolkit developed by Google for building user interfaces (UI) in Android applications.
-  [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/) : Material Design is to provide consistent and intuitive design guidelines for application development.
-  [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines?hl=id) : Coroutine is a concurrent design pattern that you can use in Android to simplify asynchronously executed code.
-  [Shared preferences](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences) : Shared Preferences are used in Android app development to store data persistently on the device.
-  [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room?hl=id) : Apps that handle non-trivial amounts of structured data can benefit greatly from persisting that data locally. The most common use case is to cache relevant pieces of data so that when the device cannot access the network, the user can still browse that content while they are offline.
